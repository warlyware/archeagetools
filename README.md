# ArcheAge Toolset

<img src="http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f154/uninvisible/archeage_zpscf3i0mgx.png">

This is a new implementation of the original project located [here](https://github.com/warlyware/waterdeep), created for the purpose of learning JavaScript, AngularJS, and CSS.  This iteration will be built on my gulp-powered seed project workflow [here](https://github.com/warlyware/seed) and incorporate learned knowledge in AngularJS and Bootstrap.

I will be rebuilding the project based on the code in the Properties and Users pages from the previous project, then developing outward.
